What is BlackJack?
==================

**BlackJack** is a card game where the objective of the game is to get your cards as close to 21 without going over and beating your opponent's cards.

Deck of Cards.
==============

When you opened a brand new deck of playing cards, there are 54 cards.  

There are 2 *Jokers* which will be discarded as we do not use Jokers in the game of BlackJack.  The remaining 52 cards are divided into 4 suits.  The suits are *Spades*, *Hearts*, *Clubs* and *Diamonds* which does not change the value of the cards in BlackJack.  Each of the suits has 13 cards.  A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.

Playing BlackJack
=================

To play BlackJack, you will need at least 2 players.  One is the *Dealer* while the other player is the *Player*.

Dealer
------
The dealer will deal one card to each player until each player and the dealer has 2 cards.

Player
------
The player will look at the card ad add the sum of the 2 cards and determine if they want to *HIT* or *STAY* based on the value of the cards.

HIT or STAY
===========
To get to 21 without going over you can **HIT** or **STAY**

To **HIT**, you will need to tap the table and the dealer will give you another card.  You can request as many cards as you want as long as you don't bust.

To **STAY**, you will simple wave your hand on top of your cards stating you don't want any cards.

Tips on BlackJack
=================
The dealer will always have one card facing up.  Therefore you can use the card and determine if you should **HIT** or **STAY**.

Some players recommends that if the dealer face card is anywhere from 2 to 16.  The rule of the BlackJack game states that if the dealer card value is less than 17 they must **HIT**.  Therefore the probability of the dealer going over 21 if the dealer's hand has a 2 to 6 face card is very high.
